# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – Jessica Costta

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  

This repository showcases hands-on projects completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and independent learning.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of cybersecurity principles across different domains, from Linux hardening to incident response and compliance audits.  


## File Permissions Management - Linux Security Controls
Identify and correct improper file and directory permissions to align with the principle of least privilege.

**Tools used:** Linux administration, access control, security hardening, authorization policy enforcement.


## Internal Security Audit - Botium Toys (NIST CSF Framework)
